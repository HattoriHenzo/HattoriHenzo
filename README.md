## About Me

Nice to meet you! üòé

I am Emmanuel (AKA Hattori Henzo on GitHub) - Software Engineer, Open Source contributor and passionate about technology :star2: :computer:

I like exploring and solving problems, and very curious about any field in Software Engineering and Computer Science.

Currently, I'm a Lead BackEnd Developer in the insurance domain, designing and implementing API(s) following a Cloud Native and Microservice distributed architecture on the Cloud (Azure/AWS mainly on Kubernetes AKS/EKS).

## Main Areas of Interest üí°

- Software Engineering and Architecture 
- API Design, API Management and API Security
- System Design, Distributed Systems, Cloud Engineering
- Framework, library and SDK Design
- Teaching (my french youtube channel [here](www.youtube.com/@javathinked))

## Preview notable experience üïô

- In my previous life (as Software Engineer in a Telecommunication Company), I used to develop admistration and monitoring tools for Telecom Platforms such as Ericsson and Huawei
- I also used to work as a *Data Integrator* (I guess what is called now a *Data Engineer*), by designing *Data Pipelines* for collecting, transforming and distributing data with tools and ETL such as: IME(with Python and C) and Talend Open Studio/Microsoft SSIS
- Knowing the basics of Data Engineering, I am actively working on updating my knowledge on tools such as [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)

## Other areas of interest ‚≠ê

- :surfer: Since almost 4 years, I am working on Microservices and Distributed Systems, with a particular interest on Brokers. In my spare time I contribute to Open Source project such as [Apache EventMesh](https://github.com/apache/eventmesh). One of my big achievement is to be in the Project Management Committees(PMC) for the EventMesh project
- :slot_machine: I am also new to machine learning and I am trying to stay up to date
